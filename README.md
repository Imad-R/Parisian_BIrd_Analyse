# Parisian_BIrd_Analyse
We conducted an analysis of bird sightings per month in a Parisian park during 2022 using Python (Pandas, statsmodels.api, numpy, random, itertools) and R (factoMiner, factoExtra). Initially, we worked with a dataset containing 27 columns and 12 rows, but later we reduced the dataset to 12 columns. The study focuses on the "Perruche à collier" species. The analysis includes a descriptive analysis of the data, followed by a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We also performed simple linear regression and multiple linear regression to find the best model for predicting the variance of the "Perruche à collier".
